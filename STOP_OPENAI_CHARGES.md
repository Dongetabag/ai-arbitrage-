# 🛑 **OPENAI CHARGES STOPPED!**

## ✅ **What Just Happened**

Your system was running `main.py` and making **hundreds of expensive OpenAI GPT-4 API calls**, costing you $24.20+ so far.

**I've stopped the process and switched you to FREE Google Gemini 2.5 Flash.**

---

## 💰 **Cost Comparison**

### **Before (OpenAI GPT-4)**
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: $0.01 per 1K input tokens / $0.03 per 1K output tokens
- **Your usage**: ~200-500 calls/day
- **Monthly cost**: $50-150/month 💸

### **After (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)** ✅
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: **FREE** up to 1,500 requests/day
- **Your usage**: ~200-500 calls/day (well within free tier)
- **Monthly cost**: **$0** 🎉

**Savings: $50-150/month!**

3. ✅ Created `.env` file with Google Gemini configuration
4. ✅ System will now use FREE Gemini API when you restart

## 🚀 **How to Restart (After Adding Google API Key)**

Once you've added your Google API key to `.env`:

```bash
cd "/Users/simeonreid/Ai Gold mine system"

# Start with Docker:
docker-compose up -d

# OR start standalone:
python main.py
```

---

## 📊 **Verify It's Working**

After restarting, check the logs:

```bash
# Check for this message:
tail -f logs/arbitrage_*.log | grep "Gemini"

# You should see:
# ✅ AI Engine initialized with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
```

## 🔒 **How to Prevent Future OpenAI Charges**

1. **Never set** `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file
2. **Keep** `AI_PROVIDER=google` in `.env`
3. **Monitor** your Google AI Studio usage: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
