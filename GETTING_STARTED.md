# üéØ Getting Started - Your Path to Profitable Arbitrage

## What You Just Built

You now have a **complete AI arbitrage platform** that operates 24/7 to find and flip products for profit. Here's what it does:

### The Full Workflow (Automated)

```
1. SCAN (Every 10 min)
   ‚Üì
   Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, OfferUp, eBay, Mercari
   Finding: "Calculus Textbook - $45"
   
2. ANALYZE (Instant)
   ‚Üì
   AI checks: Is this profitable?
   - Amazon price: $89
   - Fees: $14
   - Profit: $30 (40% margin) ‚úÖ
   
3. DECIDE (AI reasoning)
   ‚Üì
   Decision: NEGOTIATE (try to get $35)
   
4. NEGOTIATE (Automated)
   ‚Üì
   AI sends: "Hi! Interested in your textbook. Would you take $35? 
              I can pick up today!"
   Seller replies: "$40 and it's yours"
   AI accepts: "Perfect! When can I pick it up?"
   
5. PURCHASE
   ‚Üì
   Coordinates pickup, processes payment
   Records receipt
   
6. LIST (Automated)
   ‚Üì
   AI creates Amazon listing:
   - Title: "Calculus: Early Transcendentals 10th Ed - Hardcover - Like New"
   - Price: $79.99
   - Ships via FBA
   
7. CUSTOMER SUPPORT (Automated)
   ‚Üì
   Buyer asks: "When will this ship?"
   AI responds: "Your order ships within 24 hours via Amazon Prime. 
                 Tracking will be sent automatically!"
   
8. PROFIT
   ‚Üì
   Sold: $79.99
   Cost: $40
   Fees: $13
   Profit: $26.99 (33.7% margin)
```

## Your First 24 Hours

### Hour 1: Setup
```bash
# Run the interactive setup
python scripts/quick_start.py

# It will ask you for:
# - AI API key (OpenAI or Anthropic)
# - Spending limits
# - Your location
# - Safety settings
```

### Hour 2: Test & Verify
```bash
# Test all API connections
python scripts/test_apis.py

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ OpenAI connected
# ‚úÖ Database connected
# ‚úÖ Keepa connected (if configured)
# ‚úÖ BookScouter connected (if configured)
```

### Hour 3: First Run (Monitoring Mode)
```bash
# Start the system (safe mode)
python main.py

# What happens:
# - Scans marketplaces for books
# - Finds 20-50 opportunities
# - AI analyzes each one
# - Saves to database
# - Waits for your approval (auto_purchase=false)
```

### Hour 4-24: Review & Learn
```bash
# View what the system found
python scripts/daily_report.py

# You'll see:
# - All opportunities discovered
# - AI's decision on each
# - Estimated profit
# - Risk scores

# Review the top opportunities
# Manually purchase a few to test
# List them on Amazon/eBay
```

**Month 1 Total Target: $2,600-4,000 profit**

## Month 2-3: Autonomous Operation

### Enable Full Automation
```yaml
# config/settings.yaml
automation:
  auto_purchase: true    # For proven categories
  auto_list: true
  auto_negotiate: true
  auto_respond_support: true

risk_management:
  max_purchase_per_item: 500
  max_daily_spend: 2000
  min_profit_margin: 0.20
```

### Scale to All Categories
- Enable all 10 categories
- Set up Tactical Arbitrage for overnight scanning
- Add more pricing APIs
- Expand geographic coverage

**Expected: $3,000-7,000/month profit**

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Location Optimization
```yaml
# .env
PRIMARY_LOCATION=Boston, MA  # ‚Üê Change this to your area
SEARCH_RADIUS_MILES=50
ZIPCODE=02101  # ‚Üê Your zip code
```

**Pro tip:** College towns = 2-3x more textbook opportunities

### 2. Rapid Response
- System scans every 10 minutes
- First responder gets the deal 80% of the time
- AI negotiates within seconds
- You have the advantage!

### 3. Category Selection
Start with highest margin:
1. Books (47.3%) - Easiest to start
2. Trading Cards (36.8%) - Higher value
3. Video Games (34.2%) - Good volume

### 4. Pricing Accuracy
More pricing APIs = better decisions:
- Keepa (essential for Amazon)
- BookScouter (essential for books)
- Category-specific (TCGPlayer, PriceCharting, etc.)

## Common First-Week Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Too Many Opportunities!"
**What happened:** System found 200 opportunities in first scan  
**Why:** Fresh database, scanning backlog  
**Solution:** 
```python
# Increase min_margin to filter better
min_profit_margin: 0.30  # Only show 30%+ margin deals
```

### Scenario 2: "Not Finding Anything"
**What happened:** Zero opportunities after 24 hours  
**Why:** Settings too restrictive or wrong location  
**Solution:**
- Lower min_margin to 0.15
- Increase max_purchase_price
- Verify location is set correctly
- Add more keywords

### Scenario 3: "Negotiations Not Working"
**What happened:** Sellers not responding to AI messages  
**Why:** Platform blocking automated messages  
**Solution:**
- Use manual contact for Facebook/Craigslist
- AI generates message, you send it
- Focus on platforms with API access (eBay)

### Scenario 4: "Items Not Selling"
**What happened:** Listed items but no sales  
**Why:** Priced too high or low demand  
**Solution:**
- Check competition (Keepa chart)
- Ensure in-stock on Amazon
- Improve listing quality
- Consider FBA vs FBM

## Metrics to Track

### Daily
- Opportunities found
- Purchase conversion rate
- Average profit per item
- Daily spend vs limit

### Weekly  
- Total purchases
- Total listings created
- Items sold
- Net profit
- ROI by category

### Monthly
- Profit margin by category
- Inventory turnover rate
- Customer support tickets
- Account health metrics

## When to Scale Up

‚úÖ Enable auto_purchase when:
- [ ] You've manually reviewed 100+ opportunities
- [ ] Actual margins match AI predictions (¬±5%)
- [ ] 90%+ of AI decisions were correct
- [ ] Zero problem purchases in last 50
- [ ] Comfortable with the risk

‚úÖ Increase daily spend when:
- [ ] Consistent positive cash flow
- [ ] Inventory turning over in <30 days
- [ ] Capital available to invest
- [ ] Confident in AI decisions

‚úÖ Add categories when:
- [ ] Current categories running smoothly
- [ ] API for that category configured
- [ ] Understand the market dynamics
- [ ] Have storage space for inventory

## Red Flags to Watch

üö© **Stop and review if:**
- Actual margins <10% below AI estimates
- More than 2 problem purchases in a day
- Daily spending approaching limit too fast
- Items not selling within 60 days
- Customer complaints increasing

## Getting Help

### Check System Health
```bash
# View today's activity
python scripts/daily_report.py

# Test all APIs
python scripts/test_apis.py

# Check logs for errors
tail -f logs/arbitrage_*.log
```

### Common Issues

**"ImportError: No module named 'X'"**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"API key invalid"**
- Check .env file has correct key
- Verify key hasn't expired
- Test key manually on provider's website

**"Database error"**
```bash
# Reinitialize database
python scripts/init_db.py
```

**"Not finding opportunities"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify marketplaces are accessible
- Review category settings
- Check logs for scraping errors
